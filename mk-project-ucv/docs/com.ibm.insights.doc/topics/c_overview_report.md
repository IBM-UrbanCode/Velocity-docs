# Report overview

Reports provide deployment metrics about your continuous delivery process. Giving you insights into how efficient the deployment processes and resources are performing.

The historical information contained in a report is dependent on the parameters selected for the report. For example, you may elect to gather only data about deployment duration and volume over time or deployment failure rate by application and environment or both. The data provided in a report is aggregated from the UrbanCode Deploy servers that are integrated with UrbanCode Velocity.

There are several predefined reports which are ready to use after installation and setup has been completed. You can modify the predefined reports or create your own based on your requirements.

-   **Audit**

    Use this report to prepare for an audit or to answer an auditor's questions and requests, such as:

    -   Where was application ABC deployed last quarter?
    -   Show me all deployments to production last month .
-   **Custom**

    Use this report to gather any type of information about your pipeline. Large amounts of data are presented in a custom report based on defined criteria. You can provide focus to a specific area by using filters, for example:

    -   Find teams that are more error prone when deploying to production.
    -   Identify which business units are the biggest customers.
    -   Monitor a critical application to show all of its activity.
