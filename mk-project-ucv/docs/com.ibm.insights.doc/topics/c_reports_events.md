# Events

Delivery transformation reports can highlight deployment events. Events are triggers in the deployment process.

Events can be added and removed from the report by clicking **Manage events** on the Show DevOps events page. You can select from the already added events and add additional events to select from. The charts in the report show a horizontal line for the selected events.
