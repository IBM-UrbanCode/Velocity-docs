# Charts

The **Report details** section of a report displays the various elements containing report details. Each element is referred to as a chart.

A chart is a physical representation of data for a specified reporting period. Charts can be a line graph, bar chart, or a table depending on the data gathered.

You can select any number of charts to display in a report. The following types of charts are available.

-   Application deploys
    -   Total application deployment counts by environment
    -   Total application deployment counts by team and environment
    -   Application deployment failure counts by environment
    -   Application deployment success counts by environment
    -   Application deployment failure counts by team and environment
    -   Application deployment volume by environment over time
    -   Application deployment volume by team over time
    -   Recent application deployment activity
    -   Application deployment volume by line of business over time
-   Component deploys
    -   Total component deployment count by application and environment
    -   Total component deployment count by team and environment
    -   Component deployment failure count by application and environment
    -   Component deployment failure count by team and environment
    -   Component deployment success count by application and environment
    -   Component deployment volume by environment over time
    -   Component deployment volume by team over time
    -   Recent component deployments by environment
-   Applications
    -   Application onboarded over time

Each line graph chart contains a header with a number of tasks that can be performed on the chart. At the left of the task bar are the following icons:

-   **![](../images/icon_charts_filter.jpg)**

    Edit the filters to narrow or broaden the data in the chart. You can filter data by time, environment, application, team, line of business, and deployment results.

-   **![](../images/icon_charts_viewdetails.jpg)**

    View the actual data used to create the chart.

-   **![](../images/icon_delete.jpg)**

    Delete the chart.


Additional tasks are available when the cursor is within the graph itself. You can download the graph as a PNG filetype, pan the graph, zoom in and out, scale the graph, and toggle spike lines using the icons that appear within the graph \(![](../images/graph_tasks.jpg)\).

When hovering the cursor at various locations on the graph, information about the lines is displayed, such what each line represents and the value at the cursor location. ![Sample line graph of Application deployment volume by team over time](../images/charts_linegraph.jpg)

## Detail pages

For the line graph charts, you can view the data details in a table format. The table can be re-formatted to hide columns that are not important at the time and column reordered. Click the table design icon \(![](../images/icon_charttable.jpg)\) to hide and show the defined columns. ![](../images/chartlayouteditor_example.jpg)
