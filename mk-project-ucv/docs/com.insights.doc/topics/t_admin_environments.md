# Managing logical environments

Use the Environment mapping settings page to group together a set of UrbanCode Deploy environments into a logical environment.

This task requires that you are a member of an UrbanCode Deploy system team.

A logical environment is collections of UrbanCodeâ„¢ Deploy environments. You can group your environments into logical environments in any way that makes sense for your organization. For example, mapping all of your production environments into a single logical environment, you can view aggregate information about all of your production environments in one report or chart.

A set of predefined logical environments are available to use. You can add, edit, and remove logical environments to match your environment. To remove a logical environment, click the delete icon next to the name of the logical environment to be removed.

To add to the list of predefined logical environments, complete the following steps.

1.   Click **Create** 
2.   In the Create logical environment window, type a name for the logical environment in the **Logical environment name** field. Optionally, you can add a description.
3.   Click **Save**. The new logical environment displays in the list and you can add patterns to map environments.
