# Creating header/note tasks

Header tasks represent organization elements that you can add to deployment plans. If you create a task group, you might identify the group with a header task. Header tasks can have dependencies like any other task.

You can organize task groups with header/note tasks. You can create a note by adding information about a group or task. When you import a deployment plan from IBM UrbanCode Release, segment tasks are bracketed by note-type Start Segment and End Segment tasks. Segment dependencies are represented by dependencies to End Segment tasks.

To create a header task, complete the following steps:

1.   On the Deployment plan detail page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, select a task before using the **Create Task**. The new task is inserted above the selected task.
2.   On the Create Task dialog box, in the **Type** list, select **Header**. 
3.   In the **Name** field, enter a name for the task. 
4.   In the **Description** field, enter or paste a description. You might enter a note, a reminder, or other instructions in the field.
5.   Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.
