# Running scheduled deployments

A scheduled deployment starts automatically at its scheduled time if any of its auto tasks are eligible to start.

If a deployment plan does not contain any eligible auto tasks, start the deployment by manually starting one of the eligible tasks. If the deployment plan belongs to a pipeline-generated release, you can start the deployment directly from the pipeline.

You can manually start a scheduled deployment at any time even if the plan has eligible auto tasks.
