# Managing task groups

You can combine two or more tasks into a task group. When you create a group, you define the whether the group task are executed sequentially or in parallel.

You can recognize task groups in the list of task, there is a bar connects the grouped tasks and contains an icon to identify if it is a parallel or sequential group.

-   parallel ![parallel group select](../images/para-select.png)
-   sequential ![sequential group select](../images/seq-select.png)

The following image shows a parallel group. ![parallel group](../images/group-select.png)

You can manage task groups in several ways:

-   To move a group, select the group select bar or click anywhere on the group, and then drag it to a new location.
-   To copy a group, select the group and click **Copy** ![copy icon](../images/copy-group.png), and then place the cursor where you want to insert the copied group and click **Paste** ![paste icon](../images/paste-group.png).
-   To cut a group, select the group and click **Cut** ![cut icon](../images/cut-group.png).
-   To ungroup a group, select the group and click the **Ungroup** icon ![ungroup icon](../images/ungroup-icon.png) on the group select bar.
-   To delete the tasks in a group, select the group and click **Delete** ![delete button](../images/trash-group.png). The tasks are removed from the deployment plan.
