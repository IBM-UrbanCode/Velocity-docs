# Archiving deployment plans

You can remove deployment plans from releases by archiving them.

Deployment plans cannot be permanently deleted, but can be archived. When you archive a deployment plan, it has a status of **Archived** and is not displayed in the list of plans on a release detail page.

You can view archived deployment plans and restore them by clicking **Archived** on the Releases page.

1.   Click the **Plan** tab for a release to view a list of associated deployment plans. 
2.   Click the Overflow menu icon \(![](../images/seq-select.png)\) and click **Archive this plan** on the line of the plan to be archived. Repeat this step for each plan to be archived.
