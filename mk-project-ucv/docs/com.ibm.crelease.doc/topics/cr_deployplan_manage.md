# Managing deployment plans

You can change existing deployment plans and view current status from the deployment plan detail page.

The deployment plan detail page displays a list of tasks, properties, versions, and the change history associated with the plan.

-   Click the **Tasks** tab to work with the tasks in the plan. You can add tasks, schedule tasks, skip a task, and reopen a completed task.
-   Click the **Properties** tab to view properties and their value.
-   Click the **Versions** tab to view versions.
-   Click the **Change history** to view a list of the changes, revision number, user who made the revision, and date. You can also restore a plan to a specific version by clicking the restore icon \(![](../images/restore-icon.png)\).

From this page you can modify and archive the plan, change the name of the plan, make a copy of the plan, and create a template from the plan. Access these features from the overflow menu icon \(![](../images/seq-select.png) \) at the top right corner of the page.

-   Click **Edit** to modify the deployment plan. With this option, you can add events and tags to the release event.
-   Click **Copy** to copy a deployment plan. A copy of the selected plan is added to the release.
-   Click **Copy as template** to create a template based on this plan.
-   Click **Archive plan** to remove the deployment plan from the release. Removed plans are not permanently deleted and can be added to another release.
