# Copying deployment plans

You can duplicate deployment plans by copying them.

The status of a copied or promoted plan is \`draft\` even if the original plan has a status of \`done\` or \`in progress\`.

1.   To copy a plan, use the **Copy plan** action on the Deployment Plan page. When you copy a plan, a new plan with the name "Copy of \`plan\_name\`" is inserted into the Deployment Plan page. The copied plan contains all the tasks that are defined in the original plan. If UrbanCode Deploy tasks are in the plan, the applications, versions, and environments that are selected in the original are also selected in the copied plan. Applications, versions, and environments are displayed on the \*\*Versions\*\* tab on the Deployment Plan Detail page. 
2.   To create a template from a plan, use the **Copy as template** action On the Deployment Plan page. When you copy a plan as a template, a new plan with the name "Copy of \`plan\_name\`" is inserted into the Templates page. The copied plan contains all the tasks that are defined in the original plan. If UrbanCode Deploy tasks are in the plan, the applications, versions, and environments that are selected in the original are also selected in the template.
