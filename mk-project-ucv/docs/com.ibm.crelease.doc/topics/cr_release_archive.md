# Archiving releases

You can archive a release to remove it from the list of releases.

Although you cannot delete a release, you can store it in the archives. Archived releases are not displayed on the Releases page.

To archive a release, locate the release in the list and click the overflow icon \(![](../images/seq-select.png)\). Then click **Archive**. Repeat this action for each release to be archived.

You can view archived releases and restore them by clicking **Archived** on the Releases page.
