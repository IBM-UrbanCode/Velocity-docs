# License management

UrbanCode™ Velocity Standard Edition provides a 60-day license-free evaluation period.

Unless you configure a license when you install UrbanCode Velocity Standard Edition, a 60-day evaluation period begins. During evaluation, you can use all product features. By the end of the 60-day trial, you must configure a license. You can apply a license at any time.

**Note:** The UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition is free to use and does not require a license.
