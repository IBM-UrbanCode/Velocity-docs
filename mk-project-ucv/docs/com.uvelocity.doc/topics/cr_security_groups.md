# Managing user groups

You can combine users into groups. When you grant permissions to the group, you simultaneously grant them to the group members. When you assign a group to a team, all group members are simultaneously assigned to the team.

**Note:** Groups cannot be imported from UrbanCode Deploy.

To create a group, complete the following steps:

1.   On the Releases page, click \*\*Settings\*\* <img class="inline" src="images/cal-set.png" alt="Settings icon"\>, and then click \*\*Groups\*\*. 
2.   On the Groups page, click \*\*New Group\*\*, and in the Add New Group window, enter a name for the group, and then click \*\*Save\*\*. 
3.   With the group selected, click \*\*Add user\*\*. 
4.   In the \*\*User\*\* list, select a user, and then click \*\*Save\*\*. The user is added to the \*\*Members\*\* list. You can add a user by typing the user's email address. The email address is used as the user name.
