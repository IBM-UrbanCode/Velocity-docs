# Managing teams

To prepare a team, you create the team and then add users or user groups to it. After you add users, you assign permissions to them.

To create a team and assign users, complete the following steps:

1.   Click **Settings** ![Settings icon](../images/cal-set.png), and then click **User authorization** \> **Teams**. 
2.   On the Teams page, click **Create team**, and in the Add new team window, enter a name for the team, and then click **Save**. 
3.   With the team selected, click **Add member** to add a user or group. 
4.   In the **Member** field, enter or select the user, and then click **Save**. The user is added to the **Member** list.
5.   New team members have no permissions. To grant permissions to a user, with the team displayed, click the permission that you want to grant. 

After a team is created, any team member can assign it to releases, pipelines, reports, and deployment plans.
