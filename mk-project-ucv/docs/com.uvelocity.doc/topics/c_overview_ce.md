# Overview of the community edition

Using UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition you can request reports based on your criterion from data retrieved from your UrbanCode Deploy environment. In addition, to reports that your create there are several out-of-the-box reports that you can use right away. Using filters, you can customize the data to view.

The information you learn from reports gives you insights into your development processes. There are number of advantages for gathering reports. You can use the information whether your environment is new to DevOps, making changes, or you have a mature DevOps process. Staying ahead means constant monitoring and improving.

Reports display in graphical charts and tables making it easy to view trends. And, you can focus in on details.
