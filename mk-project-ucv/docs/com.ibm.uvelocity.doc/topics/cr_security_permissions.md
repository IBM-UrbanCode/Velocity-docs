# Managing user permissions

Permissions define the scope of user actions. Administrators assign permissions when they add users to teams. Permissions are granted to individual users or user groups. Users can have different permissions for different teams.

New users have no granted permissions. Before users can do any meaningful work, they must be granted permissions. The permission types are described in this list:

-   The Participant permission enables users to perform all product functions except manage the security system. Users with this permission can create releases and deployment plans, and run deployments.
-   The Admin permission enables users to perform all product functions and manage the UrbanCode Velocity security system.

    **Note:** To use [UrbanCode Deploy applications with protected environments](cr_security_UCDteams.md#), a user must have the Admin permission.
