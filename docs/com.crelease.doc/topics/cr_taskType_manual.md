# Creating manual tasks

Manual tasks represent some activity that is associated with a software release. Manual tasks have a start point, end point, and a measurable duration.

To create a manual task, complete the following steps:

1.   On the Deployment plan detail page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, select a task before using the **Create Task**. The new task is inserted above the selected task.
2.   On the Create Task dialog box, in the **Type** list, select **Manual**. 
3.   In the **Name** field, enter a name for the task. 
4.   In the **Duration \(minutes\)** field, enter the number of minutes that you expect the task to run until it is completed. The estimated duration is used to calculate expected deployment times.
5.   In the **Tags** list, attach a tag to the task. You can select multiple tags. To create a tag, type the tag name in list's text field.
6.   In the **Assigned groups and users** list, select the task owner. The assigned user runs the task during deployment.
7.   Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.
