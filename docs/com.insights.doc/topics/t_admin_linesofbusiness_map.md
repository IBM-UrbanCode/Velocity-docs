# Mapping lines of business

Use the Line of business settings page to create groups of applications into lines of business \(LOBs\) that serve a common business purpose.

This task requires that you are a member of an UrbanCode Deploy system team.

Mapping lines of business can make it easier to view information of related applications that satisfy a business need.

The Line of business settings page displays a list of defined lines of businesses and the number of applications mapped to it. Applications are mapped to a line of business individually or based on patterns that you specify. To view mapping details, click the name of the line of business.

To remove a mapping, click **Remove** next to the application or pattern name. You can change a pattern by clicking **Edit** next to the pattern.

1.   To access the Line of business settings page, click **Settings** \> **Line of business mapping**. 
2.   Click the line of business name to add mappings. You can map applications by using patterns or individually.
    -   To map by pattern, complete the following tasks. Each line of business can have one or more patterns associated with it.
        1.  Click **Include patterns** \> **Add pattern**.
        2.  On the Add new pattern window, type the pattern to map applications that match the pattern. The applications that are mapped based on the pattern are displayed. You can make the pattern weaker or stronger to change the list.
        3.  Click **Add** to add the pattern to the line of business.
        4.  Close the window and the pattern is displayed in the **Pattern** list.
    -   To map individual applications, complete the following tasks:
        1.  To select by pattern, click **Individually mapped applications** \> **Add application**.
        2.  On the Add Individual Applications window, you can select individual environments. Use the **Filter application** field at the top of the page to narrow the list of applications.
        3.  Click the check box next to the application name to add or select all check box at the top of the list.
        4.  Click **Add**.
        5.  Close the window when finished. The applications mapped are displayed.
3.   Select a color to represent the line of business in reports. Click the color menu in the **Choose Color** field. Move the slide bar to the color family. Move the cursor to the point in the box for the color. Optionally, you can type the HTML color code. After you have selected a color, click **Choose**.
