# Roles and permissions

A number of roles are defined in the product that can be assigned to an user or group. Roles set boundaries on the release tasks that an user or group member can perform.

Roles are assigned to users and groups within the team context. Roles are not directly assigned to users and groups of users. Users or groups are assigned to a team with a specific role. The role assigned to a user is only for the team that the user is a member. A user can be a member of multiple teams and have a different role on each.

The interlocking concept of teams, roles, and permissions ensures that users have the appropriate permissions to perform their work and not affect processes outside of their assigned scope. The interaction of these three concepts provides the mechanisms to create an infrastructure that is secure and flexible.

The following table shows the available roles.
