# Managing users

Use the User authentication settings page to manage user authentication.

This task requires that you are an UrbanCode Velocity administrator.

Users can be authenticated from an LDAP, OAuth, or SSO system. You can defined multiple authentications, but only one can be enabled at a time. Users who are not part of an UrbanCodeâ„¢ Deploy team can also be authenticated. However, they will have access only to demo reports.

Use the User authentication settings page to add, edit, and remove authentications.

-   To remove an authentication, click the delete icon next to the user.
-   To modify an authentication, click the edit icon next to the user.

1.   To access the User authentication settings page, click **Settings** \> **User authentication**. 
2.   To add users and select the method of authentication, click **Add** . 
3.   Complete the required fields. 
4.   Click **Save**.
